# Personal Starting Place

This was a project to test out play around with some programming in Vue and using Vite. It was a personalised starting page when opening up the Firefox Browser. Unfortunately, i could not get the implementation of Google Calender to work, so i looked for another solution of a personal starting page and abandoned this project. Because of that, don't expect it to work properly.

It has some basic features like a pomodoro timer and a todo app.
